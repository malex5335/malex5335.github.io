# About Me

My Name is Maximilian Rich and was born on the 25.02.1995 in Grimma (Saxony, Germany).<br>
On August 2015 I've completed my 3 years education in Software-Development and became a Programmer afterwards.<br>
I created this Portfolio to keep track of my goals and achievments wether it's programming or general education.<br>
On this page you will find more general and current informations about me.<br>
On the left there is a Navigation where you can find more specific topics as well as other Github-Projects I work on (so long as they are public).

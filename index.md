# About Me

My Name is Maximilian Rich and was born on the 25.02.1995 in Grimma (Saxony, Germany).
On August 2015 I've completed my 3 years education in Software-Development and became a Programmer afterwards.
I created this Portfolio to keep track of my goals and achievments wether it's programming or general education.
On this page you will find more general and current informations about me.
On the left there is a Navigation where you can find more specific topics as well as other Github-Projects I work on (so long as they are public).
